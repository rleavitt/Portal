Many people contributed indispensably to the Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal as it evolved from the Passamaquoddy-Maliseet online dictionary to the Language Keepers documentation project.

The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Dictionary

David A. Francis, Robert M. Leavitt, and Margaret Apt are the authors of the print and online versions of the Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Dictionary. The dictionary has been published in book form as Peskotomuhkati Wolastoqewi Latuwewakon: A Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Dictionary (Orono, University of Maine Press; Fredericton, Goose Lane Editions, 2008). Stephen Sloan created the original online dictionary website at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton. (Please see Dictionary Credits for all contributors.)

PLEASE NOTE: The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal contains the most up-to-date versions of dictionary entries, including corrections and additional information; online entries may differ from those found in the print edition. New entries are added regularly to the portal.

The Passamaquoddy Language Preservation Project

The audio module portion of the Portal is sponsored by a grant awarded by the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) to the Passamaquoddy Tribal Historic Preservation Office to promote and preserve the tribal language. Donald Soctomah, Director. The ANA was established in 1974 through the Native American Programs Act (NAPA). The ANA project has been adding audio recordings of the entry words and example sentences since 2011. (Please see Dictionary Credits for a list of audio recorders.)
